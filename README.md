# dbt + BigQuery Analytics Engineering Project

## Overview

In this project, I explored the powerful combination of **dbt (Data Build Tool)** and **Google BigQuery**, two game-changers in modern analytics engineering. The goal was to design a clean, scalable transformation workflow that turns raw data into trusted, analytics-ready datasets using SQL-first best practices.

This project reflects my hands-on approach to learning modern data tooling and strengthening my analytics engineering skill set, particularly around transformation logic, testing, and documentation.

---

## Project Objectives

- Set up **dbt** from scratch and connect it to **BigQuery**
- Build SQL-based data transformations using dbt models
- Apply analytics engineering best practices (modularity, testing, documentation)
- Convert raw tables into views and curated datasets
- Generate dbt documentation for transparency and data trust

---

## Workflow

Throughout this project, I worked through the full dbt workflow, including:

- Initializing and configuring a dbt project
- Linking dbt to BigQuery as a data warehouse
- Writing **SQL-based transformations** using dbt models
- Converting tables to views for efficient querying
- Seeding static datasets into BigQuery using dbt
- Writing **dbt tests** to validate data quality and assumptions
- Generating and exploring **dbt documentation** for data lineage and model clarity

## Tech Stack

- **dbt (Data Build Tool)**
- **Google BigQuery**
- **SQL**
- **Analytics Engineering Best Practices**

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with **cloud-native analytics tools**
- Apply **SQL-first transformation workflows**
- Build **maintainable, testable data models**
- Think like an **analytics engineer**, not just an analyst

It also complements my broader experience across Azure and AWS-based data platforms by strengthening my multi-cloud analytics skill set.
